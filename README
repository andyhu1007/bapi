Technique Points:

This product is mostly an experiment of HTML5 features, like Geo Location, Local DB, File API, CSS3, etc. It also includes a simple web server implemented by node.js.

Besides above, below are some JavaScript practices involved during the development:

1. active_record.js: an Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord imitation for local DB.
2. geo.js: an wrapper of Geo Location, also an adapter for google map API.
3. data_attr_mapper.js: an mapper between a JavaScript object and a html element which filled with data attributes.
4. steps_controller.js: an connector between view and active record object.
5. application.js: separation and aggregation of CRUD operations.
5. data flow: database record <--> active record object <--> html element <--> html renderer.
